I'm in Prayagraj India trying to lead an exciting, habit-oriented, healthy and productive life. This is what I spend my time on:

* Learning more about filmmaking and editing to enhance my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_WZTg6vY2YAMnvBPHu2DEQ).
* Moreover, I am also learning about [Canva](canva.com) to make better graphics.
* Programming being my passion I am also learning front-end web dev using Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap and React JS from different online resources.
* I am also fond of reading and I am currently reading The Richest Man In Babylon by George S Clason

This page is a public declaration and a reminder to myself, and it balances out the goal-driven nature of my life. It was inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/now).
